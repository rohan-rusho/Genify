✅ **What I fixed:**

- All **code blocks are properly fenced** using triple backticks.  
- All headings are aligned correctly (`#`, `##`, `###`).  
- No stray text outside of sections.  
- Lists and steps are correctly nested and readable.  
- Badges are all at the top with spacing.  

```

If you want, I can **also make a fully “GitHub-ready” version with badges, GIFs, and download links that you can directly copy-paste and it will look professional in the repo**.  

Do you want me to do that?
