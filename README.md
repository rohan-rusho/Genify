## About The Project

Convertify aims to be a handy utility for everyday unit conversions. The application uses a fragment-based architecture to display different conversion tools, managed by a main activity that hosts a `BottomNavigationView`. The `ConverterFragment` is a reusable component designed to handle the UI and logic for different types of conversions.

### Core Functionality

*   **MainActivity (`MainActivity.java`):**
    *   Sets up the main layout (`activity_main.xml`).
    *   Manages the `BottomNavigationView` to switch between different converter fragments.
    *   Loads the appropriate `ConverterFragment` into a `FrameLayout` based on user selection.
*   **ConverterFragment (`ConverterFragment.java`):**
    *   A versatile fragment that can be configured for different conversion types (Length, Weight, Temperature, etc.).
    *   Dynamically populates spinners (`Spinner`) with unit options based on the `converterType` passed to it.
    *   Handles user input from an `EditText`.
    *   Performs conversion logic when the "Convert" button is clicked.
    *   Displays the conversion result in a `TextView`.
    *   Includes error handling for invalid input.
*   **Layouts (`activity_main.xml`, `fragment_converter_common.xml` - assumed):**
    *   `activity_main.xml`: Defines the main screen structure with a `FrameLayout` for fragments and a `BottomNavigationView`.
    *   `fragment_converter_common.xml` (assumed name based on `ConverterFragment`): Likely contains the UI elements for a single converter view, such as `Spinner`s for unit selection, an `EditText` for input, a `Button` for conversion, and a `TextView` for the result.

### Built With

This project utilizes the following key technologies and libraries:

*   **Java:** Primary programming language for Android development.
*   **Android SDK:** For building the application.
*   **Android Studio:** The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.
*   **Material Components for Android:** Used for UI elements like `BottomNavigationView`.
*   **AndroidX Libraries:** (e.g., `AppCompatActivity`, `Fragment`) for modern Android development practices.
